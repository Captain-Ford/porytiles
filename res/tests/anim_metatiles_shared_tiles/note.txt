Right now, compiling this tileset yields:

    detected duplicate representative anim tile, not allowed

The reason for this is if two different animations in the same tileset share any representative tiles, then we
have to fail because the compiler won't know what to do when it encounters a representative tile in the regular
tileset.

The way to solve this would be to have animations use a separate "frame" file called "representative.png", where
you use this file to specify unique representative tiles for your animation. But those tiles will never actually
appear in-game, instead they are just used in the layer PNGs to indicate that this tile should index into the
animation sequence.

The vanilla games actually do this already. If you look at the water animations, the tiles on the tilesheet that
display in Porymap don't actually correspond to any animation frame, and are never actually visible in-game.
