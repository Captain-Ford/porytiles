# Todo List

+ [Print tiles directly to the CLI!](https://github.com/eddieantonio/imgcat)

+ Use the `{fmt}` C++ library for colors and better output?

+ Add a `--guide` option that prints out the final tileset but in RGB with the correct colors

+ Add a `--report` option that prints out various statistics
    + Palette efficiency in colors-per-palette-slot: a value of 1 means we did a perfect allocation
        + calculate this by taking the `Number Unique Colors / Number Slots In Use`
    + asd

+ Set up more CI builds for Windows, Clang on Mac, etc
