# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.5] - 2023-08-18

## [0.0.4] - 2023-08-11

### Added

- Support for generating compiled animated tiles. If input path contains an `anim` folder with properly formatted RGBA
  anim assets, it will generate an `anim` folder in the output location with all anim frames correctly indexed. At the
  moment, the user must still manually enter the C code in `tileset_anims.{c,h}` to drive the actual animation.

- Colored output, more descriptive error messages

- `-Wall` and `-Werror` flags to turn on some helpful compiler warnings

### Changed

- Inputs are now provided in a given directory instead of as individual files

### Removed

- Raw compilation mode

## [0.0.3] - 2023-07-23

### Added

- Support for secondary tilesets using the `--secondary` flag. Secondary tilesets must consume the layer PNGs for their
  paired primary set, but then the compiler can use that information to take advantage of all the typical secondary
  tilset optimizations (like sharing palettes and tiles)

## [0.0.2] - 2023-07-19

### Added

- Generate `metatiles.bin` in addition to `tiles.png` and pal files (for primary tilesets only)

### Changed

- Complete algorithm overhaul from the `0.0.1` release
- CLI has been updated significantly, please see the `--help` option for info

## [0.0.1] - 2023-06-12

Preview release.

### Added

- Basic functionality: Porytiles will allocate palettes and create an indexed tilesheet for most input images
- Basic palette priming support: Porytiles allows you to force the palette allocation algorithm to guarantee that
  specified colors will be in the same palette
